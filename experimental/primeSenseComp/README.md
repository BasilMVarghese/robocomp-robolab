To install Xtion drivers go to structure.io and download the .tar file
Execute install.sh


To check the driver is working, cd to ~/Openni2XXX/Tools/NiViewer and run ./NiViewer
If you access that file from a different directory, you will probably get a "Could not open device" error

If you wnat to use SimpleViewer you need to execute it from the parent directory.
